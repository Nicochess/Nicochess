My name is Nicolas, I'm a problem solver by nature and technical problem solver by determination.  
I'm currently working with Front End Development using React JS and I have been on the field for 2 years.  
On my free time I like to hacking into websites, in order to make them more secure.  
Interesting me a lot how computer works, so you can see me always trying to get a deeper level of understanding on their behaviour.  

My tech skills:

**Front End**: HTML5; CSS: SCSS, CSS in JS; JavaScript: ReactJS,
TypeScript, Next JS. Rest API and GraphQL. Testing: Cypress, Jest.  
**Back End**: Node, Express JS, Firebase, Mongo DB.  
**Blockchain**: Solidity.  
**CyberSecurity**: Web Hacking.  

I'm currently studying Vue Framework in order to expand my knowledge related to Front End Development.
